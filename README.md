Run ES Lint
```
eslint src/** src/**/**
```

If you get an error saying something like, "ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-react"," check that your package.json file has the line, "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.12.4" in devDependencies (your version may not be identical).

If the plugin is present there . . .

Install ES Lint React plugin globally
```
npm install eslint-plugin-react -g
```

Run ES Lint again. If it still doesn't work or the plugin was not present:

Install ES Lint React plugin locally
```
npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev
```

Add a rule to .eslintrc that tells ESLint that component names and React in JSX do count as uses of a variable
```
...
    "rules": {
        "react/jsx-uses-vars": 2,
        "react/jsx-uses-react": 2,
...
```

Only do the following if ES Lint is throwing errors about 'module' not being defined.

In src/index.jsx surround the hot module replacement related code with these lines asking ES Lint to ignore this section:
```
...
/*eslint-disable */
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./components/App', () => {
    render(App);
  });
}
/*eslint-enable */
```

Add the following rules to .eslintrc rules section. Put them above the "indent" rule.
```
"react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": 2,
"react/jsx-no-undef": 2,
"react/no-multi-comp": 2,
"react/jsx-indent-props": [
    "error",
    2
  ],
"react/jsx-pascal-case": 2,
"react/prop-types": 2,
"react/jsx-indent": [
    "error",
    2
],
```

Add ES Lint to scripts in package.json:
```
...
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint 'src/**' 'src/**/**'; exit 0"
...
```

Install eslint-loader Webpack loader to work with ESLint
```

```

Add the following ES Lint loader rules to webpack.config.js rules section. Put them above the Babel loader rules.
```
{
  test: /\.jsx?$/,
  enforce: "pre",
  loader: "eslint-loader",
  exclude: /node_modules/,
  options: {
    emitWarning: true,
    configFile: "./.eslintrc.json"
    }

```
